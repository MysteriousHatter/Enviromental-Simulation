  Description: "Frogs are amphibians belonging to the order Anura (meaning \u201Cwithout
    tail\u201D). They live both in water and on land, making them ecological bridges
    between aquatic and terrestrial environments. Found on every continent except
    Antarctica, frogs are vital to ecosystems as both predators and prey, helping
    control insect populations and serving as food for birds, snakes, and mammals."
